üê∂ Project Description

Virtual Pet Simulator is a Java console application that allows users to interact with a virtual pet through a simple menu system. Users can feed the pet, let it nap, or take it for a walk. The actions are triggered by method calls within a Pet class (not shown here), simulating basic pet care and encouraging logical thinking and user interaction.

Key Features:
- Menu-driven user input using Scanner
- A looped command interface (while loop with quit option)
- Object-oriented design with a separate Pet class containing behavior methods like Feed(), Sleep(), and Walk()
- A simple, expandable structure for building more features (e.g., health stats, mood, or name personalization)

üéØ Who It's For

This project is ideal for:
- Beginner Java learners practicing:
  - Creating and using custom classes and methods
  - Loops and conditionals
  - Handling user input with Scanner
  - Structuring programs with object-oriented principles
- Students in early programming courses
- Educators looking for an interactive way to teach classes, methods, and program flow
- Aspiring game developers wanting to prototype basic game mechanics before moving to more advanced interfaces
